# PizzaCustomizer
A programming assignment to design a web app for designing a pizza would involve creating a user Interface that allows the user to drag and drop a pizza base from a list of available options into an empty circle Once the base is selected, a list of ingredients should appear that the user can then drag and drop onto the base.
